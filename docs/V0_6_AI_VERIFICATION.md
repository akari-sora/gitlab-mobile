# v0.6 AI verification ledger

MR1 implements the plain-Dart security core only. `MERGELINE_AI_ASSISTANT`
defaults to false. No AI controllers, settings, entry points, or provider calls
are wired into the application by this slice (plan §9.1–§9.2).

## Evidence boundaries

| Lane | MR1 scope / status |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint policy, SSE, failures, redaction, transcript and provider contracts | FIX1 source is commit `1abb72960ff544c803db75ce88302ac88380701d`; pipeline pending. FIX2 is a local uncommitted patch against that commit, pending its own source commit and pipeline. Local synthetic checks do not establish CI acceptance. |
| Existing Flutter behavior | Original author reported a full-suite pass; no retained receipt or job URL is available here. FIX1 does not rerun the full Flutter suite. |
| Localization | All 24 catalogs contain AI translations at `bafe8ad`; FIX1 adds no messages. Catalog generation and translation guards are checked locally. |
| GitLab/private-resource integration | NOT_RUN; MR1 does not use the GitLab API |
| Native provider conformance / P0 | NOT_RUN; plan §9.4, before MR2 |
| Android/iOS, accessibility and AOT performance | NOT_RUN; subsequent device/release lanes |
| Pipeline / job URLs | Commit `1abb72960ff544c803db75ce88302ac88380701d`: pipeline pending; no verified job URL retained here. FIX2: pipeline pending submission of the local patch. |

## FIX1 security-core corrections

FIX1 corrections are recorded in commit
`1abb72960ff544c803db75ce88302ac88380701d` (pipeline pending). Preserve exact-source
test evidence and job URLs in the MR when submitting further corrections.
No original full-suite claim is upgraded by local checks.

Redaction now detects exact secrets and structural patterns against the same
original input, merges overlapping spans and replaces once. This supersedes the
sequential replacement order in plan §5.6: a known prefix must not disable another
detector. A marker that contains a known secret causes `policyBlocked`. URL
userinfo uses the same marker, and rescanning a redacted result is idempotent.
Assignment identifiers and URL authorities are scanned once; JWT starts exclude
base64url continuation characters. PEM matching uses original-input offsets,
recognizes inline END and encrypted/PGP private-key blocks. FIX2 searches for the
matching END with `indexOf` in reusable bounded windows: at most 32,768 UTF-16
code units (64 KiB), starting at BEGIN. Blank lines, armor headers and line counts
do not truncate a private key. If END does not fit in the window, the entire
window is redacted, including nested BEGIN markers. Windows are copied only on
refill; same-line blocks never rescan or copy the remaining line. Only an immediate
CR/LF terminator after a matching END is consumed. Prefixed credential headers
are recognized at identifier boundaries. Plain `ssh://git@host` remains visible;
passwords, opaque URL tokens and known secrets remain redacted.
Host timed regressions use a three-second bound for 2 MiB hostile input; the JWT test
first rejects a quadratic implementation at 32 KiB with a one-second bound. The
three-second full-size bound allows host contention in the parallel test suite.
FIX2 adds exact 2 MiB single-line PEM cases with and without trailing spaces,
each bounded to one second on the host. Synthetic armored PGP (>100 body lines)
and RSA PEM (larger than an 8192-bit key) fixtures contain no real secrets.
Emulator AOT <300 ms remains NOT_RUN.

Transcript final-answer notes have explicit injection provenance and a dedicated
`addFinalAnswerNote()` operation. Ordinary `addFollowUp()` treats all text as user
content, including text equal to the system note. Both user-entry and tool-results
tails support follow-ups; frozen entries remain immutable. FIX2 removes an
injected final-answer note before appending an ordinary follow-up, preserving any
identical user-authored note text.

## Later MR evidence

Record the exact source commit and pipeline/job URLs for each stacked MR; never
reuse an earlier MR's pipeline as proof for later source (plan §8.7).

- MR2: three wire adapters, lossless replay, synthetic fixtures and P0 evidence.
- MR3: settings stores, encrypted history and account-removal recovery.
  `SecretSetId` uses a process-local HMAC key and must not be persisted.
- MR4: read-only tools, redaction across every outgoing runner path, live-secret
  rotation and frozen-prefix validation, budgets and lifecycle races.
  Expand the best-effort corpus for camelCase secret names, `PGPASSWORD`, Ruby
  hash assignments, SFTP userinfo and passwords with unencoded URL slashes.
- MR5: settings, versioned consent and model-sensitive data-use disclosure.
- MR6: chat, context entry points, draft insertion, mention checks and reports.
- MR7: gate enablement, native declarations, full device/accessibility evidence
  and store/release checks.

## Provider matrix (no live calls in MR1)

| Provider / format | Model | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native OpenAI / Responses and Chat | Not selected | NOT_RUN |
| Native Anthropic / Messages | Haiku only during later authorized P0 | NOT_RUN |
| OpenCode Go / Responses, Chat and Messages | Exact model × format requires separate P0 proof | NOT_RUN |
| Ollama / LAN cleartext | Not selected | NOT_RUN |
| Other presets and custom endpoints | Not selected | NOT_RUN |

A model or preset definition is configuration metadata, not verification. Native
and proxy evidence remain separate. Secrets, private bodies and private traces
must never be attached to this ledger.
